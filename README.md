LIST contributors

List contributors to the specified repository and sorts them by the number of commits per contributor
in descending order.This endpoint may return information that is a few hours old because the GitHub

REST API v3 caches contributor data to improve performance.
GitHub identifies contributors by author email address. This endpoint groups contribution counts by GitHub user

which includes all associated email addresses.To improve perfomance only the first 500 author email addresses in
the repository link to GitHub users.The rest will appear as anonymous contributors without associated GitHub user information.
