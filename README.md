She regned in Persia with magicians who once died, as the rulers of the world perish ,abussing their power; she gave india the most 
wonderful legends and the incredible luxury of poetry charm and horror of her emblems she civilized Greece to the sound of the
lyre of Orpheus in the bold calculations of Pythagorasshe concealed the principles of all the scinces and the whole progress of the
human spirit; the fable was full of her miracles, and the story itself, when it was taken to judge this unknown force, merged with the
fable; with her oracles, she shook or asserted the empire forcing the tyrants to turn pale and through curiosity or fear, dominated
all minds.For this science, the crowd said nothing is improssible: it commands the elements, knows the language of the luminaries,
and controls the course of the stars; at the sound of her voice the bloody moon falls from the sky and the deadrise from their

graves ... Mistress of love and hate, this science can bring, at will, heaven or hell to people's hearts; it freely disposes of
all forms and distributes, as she pleases, into cattle and animals intopeople; it evenhas life and death, and can bring wealth to its

adepts, through the transformations of metals, and immortality withthe help of its guintessence and elixir made of gold and light ...
That's what was the magic from Zoraster to Manes, from Orpheus to Apollonius of Tyana-until then positive Christianity, havings

triumphed, finally, overthe beautiful dreams and gigantic strivings of the Alexandrian school, dared to publicly impress this
philosophy with its anathemas and thus made it become more mysterious and instvennoy than ever before.

Perfect word is the triad because it supposes an intelligent principle a speaking principle and a principle spoken. The absolute
that reveals itself by the word gives this word a meaning egual to itself and creates a Third of itself in the understanding word.

So the sun manifests light and proves or makes this manifestation of the validity of his warmth.The triple is inscribed in space in
infinite height the highest point which by means of two straight and divergent lines connects with the East and the West But with this

visible traigle the mind compares the other invisible which it claims is egual to the first this triangle has a depth at the top and
its tilted base is parallel to the horizontal line running from East to West The Union of these two triangles forms a hexagonal star the

sacred mark of Solomon's seal the shining star of the macrocosm.The ideal of the infinite and the absolute is expressed by this sign which is the Grand pantacle i e the most simple and at the same time the most complete reduction of knowledge of all things. Grammar

itself attributes to the word (verb verbe au) three persons.The first says the second that which is spoken and third what l'm saying.
The infinite principle creating speaks to itself about itself.This is the explanation of the triple and the origin of the doctrine of

the Trinity.The magical teaching is also one in three and three in one.What is at the top is like or rgual to what is at the bottom.
Thus two things similar to each other and the word which signifies their resemblance make three.Triple-a universal teaching. in magic-

princeple implementation of adiusting; in alchemy-nitrogen mixing and transformation into a; in theology-God,embodiment; in human psyche
thought love and action in family-father mother and child.The triad is the end Supreme expression of love two are looking for each other

to become three.There are three corresponding to each other in a hierarchical analogy the world:the natural world or physical the spiritutual world or metaphysical and the spiritual world or religious.From this principle follows the hierarchy of spirits divided

into three digits and these digits are then divided again by three.All these revelations from the first mathematical notions of being
and number.Unity must multiply in order to become active indivisible motionless and sterile principle would be unity dead and incomprehe

nsible.
