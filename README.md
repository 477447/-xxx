# Authentication

There are three ways to authenticate through GitHub API v3.Reguests that reguire authentication will
return 404 Not Found instead of 403 Forbidden in some places.This is to prevent the accidental
leakage of private repositories to unauthorized users.

Summary representations

When you fetch a list of resources, the reponse includes a subset of the attributes for that resource.
This is the "summary" representation of the resource.(Some attributes are computationally expensive

for the API to provide. For performance reasons, the summary representation excludes those attributes.
To obtain those attributes.fetch the detailed representation.)

# Example:When you get a list of repositories you get the summary representation of each repository.
Here we fetch the list of repositories owned by the octokit organization:

# Detailed representations

When you fetch an individual resource the response typically includes all attributes for that resource.
This is the detailed representation of the resource.(Note that authorization sometimes influences the

amount of detail included in the representation)

# Example:When you get an individual repository, you get the detailed representation of the repository
Here we fetch the octokit.rd repository:
