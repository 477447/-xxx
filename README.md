Hello-World
path = C:\\Program Files\\Perforce\\p4merge.exe
As before, if inside [mergetool "p4merge"] or [difftool "p4merge"] there is a cmd option, it needs to be removed so that Git doesn't try to execute it.
   else:
        logfile.write('%s %s\n'%(photo.id, photo.description))
set_wallpaper(imgpath)
